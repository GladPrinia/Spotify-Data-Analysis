# Spotify-Data-Analysis
🎵 Spotify Music Data Analysis
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Spotify music data using Python to uncover insights about song attributes, artists, and user listening behaviors. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the goal is to identify patterns in music preferences, relationships between different song features (such as tempo, danceability, and acousticness), and trends over time.

The insights derived aim to support data-driven understanding of the music industry, artist performance, and evolving listener habits.

🎯 Project Objective

Analyze Spotify tracks to understand how various song characteristics affect popularity.

Explore the relationship between features like tempo, danceability, energy, and valence.

Identify top-performing artists, popular genres, and musical trends across years.

Generate data visualizations to communicate meaningful patterns and insights.

🧩 Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed metadata for songs and their characteristics from Spotify’s public repositories or API.

Feature	Description
Song Name	Title of the song.
Artist	Performer or creator of the song.
Genre	Musical category or style of the track.
Popularity	Popularity score based on listen count.
Danceability	Suitability for dancing (0–1).
Energy	Intensity or activity level of the track (0–1).
Tempo	Speed of the song in beats per minute (BPM).
Acousticness	Measure of acoustic sound (0–1).
Loudness	Overall volume of the song in decibels (dB).
Valence	Positivity or mood of the music (0–1).

📦 Data Source: Publicly available datasets derived from Spotify’s API or online repositories such as Kaggle.

⚙️ Project Implementation
1. Data Preparation

Load Data: Import and inspect dataset using Pandas.

Handle Missing Values: Clean incomplete or missing entries.

Standardize Data: Normalize numerical columns for uniform analysis.

Feature Engineering: Derive new metrics such as artist rank, song popularity tiers, and genre trends.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics: Compute mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of features.

Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships (e.g., danceability vs. tempo).

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Examine individual features and pairwise relationships.

Outlier Detection: Detect and handle anomalies in loudness, tempo, etc.

3. Data Visualization

Data is visualized using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to enhance interpretation:

📊 Histograms – Distribution of tempo, energy, danceability, etc.

📈 Scatter Plots – Relationships between features (e.g., energy vs. tempo).

📉 Boxplots – Variability in features like loudness or valence.

🔥 Heatmaps – Correlation between song attributes.

🏆 Bar Charts – Popular genres, artists, and top-performing songs.

4. Musical Trend Analysis

Time Series Analysis: Observe how song attributes and popularity evolve over years.

Genre Analysis: Identify dominant and emerging genres across time.

Artist Analysis: Track artist activity, output frequency, and popularity trends.

5. Insights Extraction

Key outcomes and observations include:

Popular Genres: Identify the most-streamed and most-loved genres.

Top Artists: Recognize artists with consistent high performance.

Feature Correlations: Determine how energy, tempo, and danceability relate to popularity.

Temporal Trends: Discover how musical preferences evolve year by year.

Playlist Strategy: Define ideal attribute combinations for curated playlists.
